Singularities, manifesting as special configuration states, deteriorate robot performance and may even lead to a loss of control over the system. This paper addresses the kinematic singularity concerns in robotic systems with model mismatch and actuator constraints through control barrier functions (CBFs). We propose a learning-based control strategy to prevent robots entering singularity regions. More precisely, we leverage Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown model mismatch, where the prediction error is restricted by a deterministic bound. Moreover, we offer the criteria for parameter selection to ensure the feasibility of CBFs subject to actuator constraints. The proposed approach is validated by high-fidelity simulations on a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) planar robot.
