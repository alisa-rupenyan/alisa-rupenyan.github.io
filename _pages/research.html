Manufacturing systems can achieve higher efficiency and flexibility through increased autonomy, but this requires solutions that work safely under uncertainty while maintaining precision. Traditional control systems assume perfect models and predictable conditions. 
Real industrial environments have unknown disturbances, changing parameters, and safety constraints where failures can be catastrophic. Our research addresses these challenges through physics-informed artificial intelligence. The approach combines understanding of manufacturing processes with machine learning, control, and optimization techniques to enable flexible automation.

<p> The main topics that we explore are: </p>

<p> <strong>Real-Time Optimization Under Uncertainty:</strong> Manufacturing systems must make optimal decisions continuously while facing incomplete information about system state, environmental conditions, and process parameters. Traditional approaches either assume perfect knowledge or fail when uncertainty levels become significant, leading to suboptimal performance or safety violations.</p>
  <p> <strong> Safe Learning in Industrial Environments:</strong>  Learning algorithms need extensive data to improve performance, but industrial systems cannot afford failures during the learning process. Developing algorithms that can learn and adapt while guaranteeing that safety constraints are never violated is necessary in manufacutirng and insdustrial relevant applications, even during exploration of unknown parameter spaces.</p>
  <p> <strong> Physics-Informed Process Control:</strong>  Manufacturing processes are governed by complex physical laws involving thermal dynamics, mechanical forces, and material properties, yet most AI approaches treat these as black boxes. Integrating fundamental physics knowledge with data-driven learning enables creating more reliable, interpretable, and efficient control systems.</p>
  <p> <strong> Adaptive Control Under Model Uncertainty</strong>: Manufacturing systems operate with incomplete or changing models due to wear, environmental variations, and process drift. Traditional control systems assume fixed models and fail when reality deviates from assumptions. We are interested in developing adaptive control systems that can learn and update their models in real-time while maintaining safety, stability, and performance guarantees.</p>
