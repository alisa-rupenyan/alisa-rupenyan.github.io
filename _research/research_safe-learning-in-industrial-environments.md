## Safe Learning in Industrial Environments

Safe learning in industrial environments focuses on developing algorithms that maximize the system's performance and efficiency, while ensuring safety constraints are met and safe exploration is enabled.

### Key aspects:
- Risk-aware learning and decision making
- Integration of safety constraints into AI and machine learning specifically in manufacturing or connected applications
- Real-world deployment and validation in industrial scenarios

### Projects
- Safe learning for robot arms (manipulation of deformable objects)
- Multi-objective optimization in industrial environments (dynamic production scheduling and optimization)

### Funding
- SNF - NCCR AUtomation
- Rieter Stiftungsprofessur
- Horizon Europe - DMaaST
