## Industrial Robotics

Industrial robotics research focuses on the development, control, and safe deployment of robots in manufacturing and industrial settings. This area explores the software aspects of robotic systems to enable flexible, autonomous, and efficient operations. Information from the manufacturing process is used to improve the control and optimization algorithms for robot operation.

### Key topics:
- Robot kinematics and dynamics
- Motion planning and trajectory optimization
- Collaborative robotics for manufacturing processes
- Vision systems and sensor integration for robots

### Projects
- Safe learning for robot arms (manipulation of deformable objects)
- Collaborative robots (cobots) for flexible manufacturing
- Robotic 3D printing toolkit

### Use Case: Robotic Winding for Additive Manufacturing
