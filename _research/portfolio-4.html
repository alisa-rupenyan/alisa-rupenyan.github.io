Our research in industrial robotics enables robot-based systems to autonomously and precisely perform manufacturing-related tasks. We combine AI methods (meta-learning, RL) with control and expert knowledge to enhance the planning and performance of tasks related to manufacturing (trajectory tracking, pick and place, and tasks requiring specific tooling).
