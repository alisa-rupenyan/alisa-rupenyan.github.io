## Real-Time Optimization and Control Under Uncertainty

Real-time optimization and control under uncertainty focuses on developing algorithms and systems for manufacturing and industrial processes that can adapt to unknown disturbances and changing conditions. The goal is to maintain safety, performance, and efficiency even when system models are imperfect or environments are unpredictable.

### Key topics:
- Modeling uncertainties in industrial processes
- Adaptive control strategies for dynamic environments
- Real-time feedback and optimization loops
- Robustness under unpredictable changes and disturbances

### Example Projects
- Robust Model Predictive Control for Flexible Manufacturing
- Adaptive Optimization Algorithms for Uncertain Systems
- Safety-Constrained Real-Time Control
