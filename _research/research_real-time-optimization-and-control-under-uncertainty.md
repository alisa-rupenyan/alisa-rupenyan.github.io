## Real-Time Optimization and Control Under Uncertainty

We develop methods for optimization and control when the systems are subject to drifts, or to time-varying disturbances. We use iterative optimization-based methods, such as Bayesian optimization, Iterative Learning Control, MPC, and reinforcement learning.

### Key topics:
- Modeling uncertainties in industrial processes
- Adaptive control strategies for dynamic environments (additive manufactuirng, fast motion stages)
- Real-time feedback and optimization loops
- Robustness under unpredictable changes and disturbances

### Projects
- Meta-learning for Control: Manufacturing and Robotics Applications
- Adaptive Data-driven Optimization Algorithms for Manufacturing Components and Processing
- High-dimensional Optimization with Digital Twins

### Funding
- SNF NCCR Automation
