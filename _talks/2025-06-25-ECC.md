I co-organized and chaired the [tutorial session on Entrepreneurship in Control](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/ECC25/program/ECC25_ContentListWeb_3.html) of the European Control Conference 2025 in Thessaloniki and gave a keynote about presenting research with entrepreneurship in mind - drawing examples from our research in control and optimization of 3D printing. Here is more info about [this tutorial](https://sites.google.com/control.ee.ethz.ch/ecc25-tutorial-startup/home). The website contains many useful resourses - in particular, how to find applications and how to extend the scope of your research. My slides are available upon request.
