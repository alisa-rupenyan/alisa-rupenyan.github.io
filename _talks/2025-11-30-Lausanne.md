 I had the honor to present the Innovation Booster Robotics in front of the robotics community in Switzerland on this year's [Swiss Robotics Day](https://swissroboticsday.ch/srd25/agenda/), and to talk about its achievements and about its excellent team. I am grateful to work with the booster for a number of years.
 
 During the Swiss Robotics Day, our group participated with the ZHAW pavilion and showed a demonstration of our robotic winding system, working seamlessly for 10 hours with path planning computed by a RL algorithm.
