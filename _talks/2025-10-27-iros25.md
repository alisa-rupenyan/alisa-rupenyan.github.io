 In manufacturing and industrial environments, environment or equipment is subject to change. By using a method based on Bayesian Optimization and safe exploration, our method optimizes continuously desired parameters based on the prescribed system performance. We include input and output constraints, which are satisfied throughout the optimization procedure. Therefore, the method is suitable for use in practical systems where safety or operational constraints are of concern. We  include contextual information, using task parameters, which makes the optimization flexible.
