 During the [this pre-ECC workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/bo2control) I presented several Bayesian optimization algorithms, suitable for optimization in manufacturing, bacause they can handle unknown safety constraints, and they can ensure continuous optimization (thus taking into account process drifts).
