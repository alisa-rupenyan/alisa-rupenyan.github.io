I had the honor to organize and moderate the [AI+X Summit track session "Beyond Automation: AI-supported Optimization for Smart Manufacturing,"](https://www.plusx.ai/2025-program/beyond-automation%3A-ai-supported-optimization-for-smart-manufacturing) bringing together leading voices from industry and academia to discuss the transformation of manufacturing systems from static automation to intelligent, adaptive systems.

The session featured distinguished speakers including Prof. Markus Bambach (ETH Zürich) on advanced manufacturing vision, Dr. Majid Nabavi (Oerlikon Digital Hub) on intelligent process control, Michael Schupp (Belimo Automation AG) on sustainable energy systems, Dr. Efe Balta (inspire AG/ETH Zürich) on AI-enabled digital twins, and my own presentation on flexible automation via AI-based approaches from ZHAW's perspective.

We explored how learning algorithms enable continuous optimization beyond traditional automation capabilities, discussing AI-powered process simulations, optimization algorithms, and real-world case studies. The session concluded with a panel discussion on the practical challenges of integrating these technologies into existing manufacturing environments and the path forward to intelligent manufacturing.
