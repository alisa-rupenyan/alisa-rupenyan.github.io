I presented our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07830) forcused on avoiding singularities in the motion of Delta robots using control barrier functions. The interesting thing about it is that model mimatch in the control approach is considered and avoided using a deterministic RKHS bound on the Gaussian process model of the mismatch. The slides are avalable [here](/assets/files/ECC_presentation_2025_rupenyan.pdf).
