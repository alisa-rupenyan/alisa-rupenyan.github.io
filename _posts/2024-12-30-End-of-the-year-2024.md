What an year that was. The group grew with two more people (although they will join in a few weeks), we published several cool publications in top venues (such as NeurIPS and Engineering Applications of AI for AI, and in IEEE TCST and IEEE TASE for control and learning). I actively joined the second phase of [NCCR Automation](https://nccr-automation.ch), with one PhD project, one postdoc project, and one industry collaboration.
