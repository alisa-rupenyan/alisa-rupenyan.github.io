2025 was an amazing year for our [group](https://alisa-rupenyan.github.io/research_group/). We tripled in size, in terms of group members, and in projects. We started work on new topics, such as building energy management via learning control (collaboration with the Swiss industry), and dynamic manufacturing scheduling approaches (Horizon EU project). We have further developed the Learning Robotics Lab with several new systems: Winding robot, AGV, and a couple of collaborative robots for manufacturing applications, also focused on deformable object manipulation. Several publications came out (non-exaustive list):...

[Differentiable Material Point Method for the Control of Deformable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13214)

[Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13170)

[Bayesian Optimization for Automatic Tuning of Torque-Level Nonlinear Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03772)
